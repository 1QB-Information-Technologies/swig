Version 3.0.9 (in progress)
===========================

2016-01-27: wsfulton
	    [Java] Fix static const char member variables wrappers with %javaconst(1).
            This fixes the case when an integer is used as the initializer, such as:

              struct W { static const char w = 100; };

2016-01-26: wsfulton
	    [Java] Fix generated code parsing enum values using char escape sequences
            when these values appear in the Java code (usually when using %javaconst(1))
            such as:

              enum X { x1 = '\n', x2 = '\1' };

            Similarly for static const member char variables such as:

              struct Y { static const char y = '\n'; }

2016-01-12: olly
	    [Javascript] Look for "nodejs" as well as "node", as it's packaged
	    as the former on Debian.

2016-01-12: olly
	    [Javascript] For v8 >= 4.3.0, use V8_MAJOR_VERSION.
	    Fixes https://github.com/swig/swig/issues/561.

2016-01-10: ahnolds
            Improved size_t and ptrdiff_t typemaps to support large values
            on platforms where sizeof(size_t) > sizeof(unsigned long) and
            sizeof(ptrdiff_t) > sizeof(long).
