  These examples/tests are for when the swig generated wrapper module is split
between two packages.  Specifically the pure python part is part of a package
and the C/C++ part is not in any package at all.  Historically swig has
supported this sort of thing.


  The -builtin option is tested as well because additional import code
is generated by swig when it is used.  The builtin tests are for this
additional code in the python wrappers.
